# Francesco Rosnati
## Master's candidate in High Performance Computing Engineering

Computer Science, Maths, Physics. I am an energetic and motivated person with a strong work ethic and an open mind to new ideas and challenges that my professional life will bring. I hate being idle; a day in which I haven't learned something new is a wasted day.
